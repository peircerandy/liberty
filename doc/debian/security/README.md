# Security in Debian

Computer Security is a huge field/topic within the industry today. Debian tackles security in different way than other operating systems. All of Debian's known security vulnerabilities are displayed out in the open. This allows for faster and more complete responses to security issues.


## Guides and Tutorials

 - [Debian Security](https://www.debian.org/security/) - general information regarding Debian Security and the team.
  - [Securing Debian Manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/index.en.html) - Debian's own hardening guide.
  - [Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/) - a tracker of vulnerable packages within Debian.
 - [How PGP works](http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/) - basic intro to PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). I hope to go more in depth on encryption and its uses.
