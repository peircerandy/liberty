## Geany ##

[Geany](http://www.geany.org/) is a text editor using the GTK+ toolkit with basic features of an integrated development environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. It supports many filetypes and has some nice features.

Geany has many plugins available, one of which I highly recommend is `geany-plugin-treebrowser` (use `apt` to install it).

There's a bunch of really nice color schemes you can install from [github.com/codebrainz/geany-themes](https://github.com/codebrainz/geany-themes)
